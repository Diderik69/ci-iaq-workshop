# Workshop "Continuous Integration für Infrastructure as Code"

This repository contains exercises for the workshop "Continuous Integration für Infrastructure as Code" that I gave on "API Summit 2021" at 9th June 2021.

The exercise description can be found in `exercise_sheet_de.pdf` (currently only in German).
The starting point of each exercise can be found in an own branch with the name pattern `exercise-<number of exercise>`.
A sample solution exists for each exercise in an own branch with the name pattern `solution-<number of exercise`.

Slides of the workshop can be found in a separate [repository](https://github.com/sparsick/iac-qa-talk/tree/apisummit21).
